This documentation uses **reStructured Text** (reST) as its markup language. The structure and syntax borrow
shamelessly from the excellent `Inkscape Beginners' Guide
<https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html>`__. Please refer to the `Sample Chapter
<https://inkscape-manuals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sample-chapter.html>`__ for an outline of the syntax and
most of the elements used in this guide.

.. note:: 

    Only some of the custom styling used in the Inkscape guide applies to this guide. When in doubt,
    refer to files in the ``static`` folder of this documentation for implementation details. Edit them as
    necessary to suit our styling needs.
