Field setup
###########

To produce :doc:`Basic videos <producing-uncalibrated>` of flights, there is nothing special you need to set
up at the field.

To produce :doc:`AR videos <producing-calibrated>`, more effort may be required. If your flying site already
has FAI F2B markers installed around the :term:`flight circle`, then the surveying work is already done. Just
measure the distance from circle center to the markers.  The elevation of the markers above the circle center
should be 1.5 meters in that case.

If your field does not have F2B markers, you can install them yourself with some specialized equipment.  You
will need at least a self-leveling rotary laser system and a laser distance measuring tool.

The recommended dimensions and placement of markers are described in **Annex 4F, Appendix II** of the `FAI
Sporting Code <https://www.fai.org/sites/default/files/sc4_vol_f2_controlline_24.pdf>`__.

In addition to the above requirements, you will need to know how to 
:doc:`place the camera </camera-placement>` correctly for best results.
