Field setup
###########

Before you go to the field, please read :doc:`camera-placement` to learn how to place the camera correctly in
the field for best results.

.. important::

    **DO NOT record the videos handheld!**
    
    **ALWAYS** mount the camera to a sturdy tripod or similar.
    
    **DO NOT** move or adjust the camera setup while recording a flight.

For Basic Videos
----------------

To produce :doc:`Basic videos <producing-uncalibrated>` of flights, you only need a suitable camera and a
tripod.

For Augmented-Reality Videos
----------------------------

To produce :doc:`AR videos <producing-calibrated>`, more effort may be required. If your flying site already
has FAI F2B :term:`markers` installed around the :term:`flight circle`, then the surveying work is already
done. Just measure the distance from circle center to the markers.  The elevation of the markers above the
circle center should be 1.5 meters in that case.

Setting Up Your Own Markers
---------------------------

If your field does not have F2B markers, you can install them yourself with some specialized equipment.  You
will need some surveying tools for this task.

    **TODO:** perhaps a separate chapter on how to DIY field markers, the recommended layout tools and
    technique, etc.???

The recommended dimensions and placement of markers are described in **Annex 4F, Appendix II** of the `FAI
Sporting Code <https://www.fai.org/sites/default/files/sc4_vol_f2_controlline_24.pdf>`__.
