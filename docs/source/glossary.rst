    Base
        The equator of the :term:`flight hemisphere`.  This lies at a height of 1.5 m above the center of the
        :term:`flight circle`.

    Figure
        A shape, which makes up a separately recognizable complete part of a whole :term:`maneuver`. For
        example, the first loop of the three consecutive inside loops maneuver is referred to as a figure; but
        the first loop which makes the first half of the first complete figure eight in the two consecutive
        overhead eight maneuver is not referred to as a figure.

    Flight circle
        A horizontal circle whose radius is equal to the flight radius.

    Flight hemisphere
        A half-globe shape whose base is level above the ground.

    Great circle
        The circular intersection of a :term:`sphere` and a plane passing through the sphere's center point.
        See `Great circle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_circle>`__.

    Horizontal
        Flight along or parallel to the :term:`base`.

    Inverted
        Condition when the model aircraft is flying in an attitude which is the reverse of :term:`upright`
        flight (colloquially, the model aircraft is "flying on its back", is "flying upside-down", or is
        "flying inverted").

    Lateral reference
        An imaginary line drawn at right angles (90 degrees) to the :term:`horizontal` and is used as a
        reference line when flying and scoring the size, positioning, symmetry and the superimposition of
        various :term:`figures <figure>` and :term:`maneuvers <maneuver>`.

    Level
        At right angles to the direction aligned with the direction of the force of gravity, as materialized
        with a plumb line.

    Manoeuvre
    Maneuver
        The full total of :term:`figures <figure>` and :term:`segments <segment>` necessary to complete the
        maneuver marked under a separate numbered heading with bold type. For example, the take-off maneuver,
        the three consecutive inside loops maneuver, and the single four-leaf clover maneuver, are all
        referred to as a single whole maneuver throughout F2B Rules.

    Momentary
    Momentarily
        Used throughout F2B Rules in their original dictionary definition sense (that is: something that lasts
        only for a very brief period of time).  So, for example, the very short period during which the model
        aircraft is required to be in a vertically-banked "knife-edge" attitude above the competitor's head
        during the two consecutive overhead eights maneuver is described in F2B Rules as "momentarily".

    Parallel
        An imaginary line on the surface of the :term:`flight hemisphere` equidistant to the equator of the
        flight hemisphere and marking the latitude.

    Segment
        A specifically defined part of a :term:`figure` (or of a whole :term:`maneuver`) in which certain
        particular points are detailed. For example, the first loop which makes the first half of the first
        complete figure eight in the two consecutive overhead eight maneuver is referred to as a segment.

    Small circle
        The circular intersection of a :term:`sphere` and a plane that does not pass through the sphere's
        center point.  See `Small circle <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_circle>`__.

    Sphere
        A three-dimensional surface, all points of which are equidistant from a fixed point.

    Straight line
        A :term:`great circle` path or part thereof.

    Upright
        Condition when the model aircraft is flying in its "normal" upright attitude (that is: with its
        landing gear nearest to the ground).

    Vertical
        Flight at right angles to the :term:`base`, along an imaginary circle on the surface of the
        :term:`flight hemisphere` marking the longitude.

    Wingover path
        The :term:`vertical` climbing and diving flight path defined as a :term:`segment` of the single
        reverse wingover :term:`maneuver`.
