Using VideoF2B
##############

The most prominent feature of VideoF2B is the drawing (tracing) of a path behind a Control Line aircraft in video.
These traces help us to visualize the figures that a Stunt pilot performed during a flight.
There are two general ways in which you can use this capability in VideoF2B: :ref:`traces only <uncalibrated>`,
and traces with :ref:`Augmented Reality <calibrated>`.

**TODO: perhaps these two are better as glossary terms?**

.. _uncalibrated:

**Traces only**

**TODO**: overview of use case with uncalibrated videos.

.. _calibrated:

**Augmented Reality (AR)**

**TODO**: overview of use case with calibrated videos.
